# runtime-api Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: WithDialect Engine option
The runtime SHALL provide a `WithDialect` construction option that selects the Dialect an Engine runs. The option SHALL be applied once at `New` and SHALL compose with the existing construction options, except that the bytecode evaluator dispatches canonical form names directly and therefore accepts only the identity Dialect.

#### Scenario: Selecting a Dialect at construction
- **WHEN** an Engine is created with `WithDialect` set to a given Dialect
- **THEN** the Engine SHALL evaluate source using that Dialect's effective special-form table

#### Scenario: Omitting the option
- **WHEN** an Engine is created without `WithDialect`
- **THEN** the Engine SHALL run the default Dialect, preserving prior behavior until the default is changed by a later change

#### Scenario: Bytecode evaluator requires the identity Dialect
- **WHEN** an Engine is created with both the bytecode evaluator and a non-identity Dialect
- **THEN** construction SHALL fail, because the bytecode path cannot honor a Dialect's renamed, added, or removed forms

#### Scenario: Unresolvable Dialect fails construction
- **WHEN** an Engine is created with a Dialect whose delta references a canonical form absent from the kernel
- **THEN** construction SHALL return an error rather than a partially-resolved Engine
