# core-engine — delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Per-evaluation reduction and allocation counters

The core evaluator SHALL carry a per-call reduction counter and a per-call
cumulative allocation counter on the `evalState` of every evaluation, never
shared across concurrent evaluations on the same engine. Step definitions are
per-evaluator and normative: the tree-walker SHALL charge one reduction per
apply-trampoline iteration and per form dispatch; the VM SHALL charge one
reduction per instruction decode; macro expansion SHALL charge one per
expansion step; the compiler SHALL charge one per emitted instruction, and
compilation allocation SHALL charge the evaluation that triggered
compilation before any chunk is cached; GoFunc dispatch SHALL charge one
reduction plus the result's shallow allocation size at the centralized apply
sites. Counter values are NOT required to be equal across evaluators.
Reduction accounting SHALL piggyback the existing batched-cancellation
countdown — no additional per-step cost and no additional clock reads.
Exceeding either ceiling SHALL raise `Code: "ResourceLimitError"`, terminal
per the non-catchability requirement, on both evaluators.

#### Scenario: Tight allocation loop fails closed

- **WHEN** an Engine runs a loop that allocates faster than it reduces, configured with `MaxAllocationBytes: 1<<20`
- **THEN** evaluation SHALL fail with `Code: "ResourceLimitError"` before the host is exhausted, and `try`/`catch` SHALL NOT intercept the error

#### Scenario: Reduction-amplified macro recursion fails closed

- **WHEN** an Engine runs a macro-amplified recursion that exceeds `MaxReductions` before tripping `MaxDepth`
- **THEN** evaluation SHALL fail with `Code: "ResourceLimitError"`

#### Scenario: Context observed within the reduction budget

- **WHEN** the caller's context is cancelled mid-evaluation
- **THEN** the evaluator SHALL stop within 1,024 reductions of the cancellation

#### Scenario: Per-evaluation counters are isolated

- **WHEN** two goroutines evaluate reduction-heavy forms concurrently on one engine under `-race`
- **THEN** each SHALL be bounded by its own counter and `go test -race` SHALL report no data race

#### Scenario: Evaluators agree on terminal behavior

- **WHEN** the same adversarial program is evaluated by the tree-walker and by the VM under identical limits
- **THEN** both SHALL terminate with the same terminal error class; counter values MAY differ between evaluators

#### Scenario: Direct Apply path is metered

- **WHEN** a host invokes a Lisp function via `core.Evaluator.Apply` without going through an `Engine` entry point, under tight limits
- **THEN** the evaluation SHALL be bounded by the same per-evaluation counters
