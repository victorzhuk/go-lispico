# runtime-api Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: WithDialect Engine option
The runtime SHALL provide a `WithDialect` construction option that selects the Dialect an Engine runs. The option SHALL be applied once at `New` and SHALL compose with the existing construction options.

#### Scenario: Selecting a Dialect at construction
- **WHEN** an Engine is created with `WithDialect` set to a given Dialect
- **THEN** the Engine SHALL evaluate source using that Dialect's effective special-form table

#### Scenario: Omitting the option
- **WHEN** an Engine is created without `WithDialect`
- **THEN** the Engine SHALL run the default Dialect, preserving prior behavior until the default is changed by a later change
