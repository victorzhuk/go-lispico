## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Map representation efficiency

`HashMap` SHALL keep its public semantics — immutable operations, key domain,
`Int`/`Float` key distinctness, deterministic iteration — while meeting
efficiency bounds: a map operation SHALL NOT format a key into a string;
iterating a map SHALL NOT allocate or re-sort per call for maps at or below the
small-map threshold; and constructing, reading, or copying a small map SHALL
allocate O(1) objects. Promotion between the small and large representations
SHALL be semantically invisible: equality, iteration order rules, printing, and
immutability are identical at both representations.

#### Scenario: Small-map operations are allocation-bounded

- **WHEN** a map literal with at most the threshold number of keys is built, read with `Get`, extended with `Assoc`, and iterated
- **THEN** `Get` and iteration SHALL allocate nothing and `Assoc` SHALL allocate only the new map's storage

#### Scenario: Numeric keys never format

- **WHEN** `Get`, `Set`, `Assoc`, or `Dissoc` runs with an `Int` or `Float` key
- **THEN** the operation SHALL NOT allocate a formatted string representation of the key

#### Scenario: Promotion is invisible

- **WHEN** a map grows past the small-map threshold via `Assoc` and later shrinks via `Dissoc`
- **THEN** equality with a same-pairs map, iteration determinism, and immutability SHALL hold identically before and after promotion

#### Scenario: Iteration order is deterministic

- **WHEN** the same map value is iterated or printed repeatedly, at either representation
- **THEN** the order SHALL be identical on every iteration and identical across both evaluators
